    relevance: "supports", 
    summary: "AI reduces extraneous load by 40%, allowing for deeper 'germane' processing.",
    notes: "This is my primary evidence for the 'offloading' argument. Need to contrast this with the atrophy argument.",

    author: "Johnson, M. et al.",
    year: "2023",
    journal: "Int. J. of AI in Education",
    relevance: "neutral",
    summary: "A broad overview of 50+ papers. Finds mixed results depending on implementation strategy.",
    notes: "Good for the background section. Doesn't strongly support either side but provides context.",

    author: "Williams, B.",
    year: "2023",
    journal: "Cognitive Science Today",
    relevance: "contradicts",
    summary: "Argues that reliance on AI prompts bypasses the neural pathways required for critical analysis.",
    notes: "The main counter-argument. I need to address this directly. Maybe argue that 'prompt engineering' is the new critical thinking?",
